# Music-Genre-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
In a music genre classification project using the GTZAN dataset, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are employed to analyze audio features and classify tracks into different genres. 
A music genre classification project using the GTZAN dataset typically involves developing machine learning models that can automatically classify pieces of music into one of several genres based on their audio characteristics. In this project, both Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are utilized due to their unique capabilities in handling sequential and spatial data, respectively.



**Dataset Overview**


The GTZAN dataset is a widely-used resource in the field of music genre classification. It contains 1000 audio tracks, each 30 seconds long, divided evenly across 10 genres: 
blues,
classical,
country, 
disco, 
hip-hop, 
jazz, 
metal, 
pop, 
reggae and 
rock. 
This diversity in music styles presents a challenging yet comprehensive dataset for training and evaluating classification models.



**Model Architecture**


**CNNs:** CNNs are used primarily for extracting spatial features from spectrograms of the audio tracks. Spectrograms, which are visual representations of the spectrum of frequencies in a sound as it varies with time, are fed into the CNN. The CNN effectively captures patterns like rhythms and textures, which are crucial for recognizing different music genres.

**LSTMs:** LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) particularly effective for sequential data processing. In this project, LSTMs analyze the temporal features of the music tracks. By processing the time-series data, LSTMs help in understanding the long-term dependencies and dynamics within the music, which are vital for capturing the essence of different genres.



**Implementation Details**


**Feature Extraction:** The first step involves extracting meaningful features from the audio files. This usually includes generating spectrograms and possibly extracting other features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), chroma features, and spectral contrast.

**Model Training:** Separate or combined architectures of CNNs and LSTMs are trained on the extracted features. The training process adjusts the weights of the network to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual genre labels.

**Evaluation:** The performance of the models is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The evaluation helps in fine-tuning the models and selecting the best performer for deployment.



**Challenges and Solutions**


**Variability in Music Tracks:** Due to the diversity and complexity of music tracks, capturing all relevant features that distinguish genres can be challenging. Using a combination of CNNs and LSTMs helps mitigate this by capturing both spatial and temporal features.

**Overfitting:** Given the limited size of the GTZAN dataset, models can easily overfit. Techniques like dropout, regularization, and data augmentation (e.g., varying the pitch and speed of audio tracks) are employed to prevent this.

**Class Imbalance and Bias:** Even distribution of tracks in GTZAN helps avoid class imbalance, but biases in genre definition and labeling can still affect performance. Cross-validation and external validation with another dataset can help assess and improve the robustness of the model.



**NOTE:** This project aims to leverage the strengths of CNNs and LSTMs to build a robust classifier that efficiently and accurately classifies music genres, making it useful for applications in music streaming, archiving, and recommendation systems.
